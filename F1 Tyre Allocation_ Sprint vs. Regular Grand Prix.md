## F1 Tyre Allocation: Sprint vs. Regular Grand Prix Weekends (2025)

Tyre allocation for Formula 1 race weekends varies depending on whether it’s a standard Grand Prix or a Sprint event. The distribution covers all sessions from Free Practice through to the Grand Prix.

### Regular Grand Prix Weekend

Each driver receives:

- **13 sets of dry-weather (slick) tyres**:
    - 2 sets Hard (white)
    - 3 sets Medium (yellow)
    - 8 sets Soft (red)
- **4 sets of Intermediate tyres** (green)
- **3 sets of Full Wet tyres** (blue)

**During the weekend:**

- Sets must be returned after each Free Practice session (2 per session).
- One set of Soft tyres is reserved for Q3 in qualifying.
- At least two different slick compounds must be used during the Grand Prix if it remains dry[^1][^2][^3][^4].


### Sprint Weekend

Each driver receives:

- **12 sets of dry-weather (slick) tyres**:
    - 2 sets Hard (white)
    - 4 sets Medium (yellow)
    - 6 sets Soft (red)
- **5 sets of Intermediate tyres** (green)
- **2 sets of Full Wet tyres** (blue)

**Tyre usage specifics:**

- A new set of Mediums is mandatory for each of SQ1 and SQ2 during Sprint Shootout qualifying; Soft (new or used) required for SQ3[^1][^5][^3][^6][^7][^4].
- Free choice of tyres for both Sprint and Grand Prix races.
- After certain sessions, sets must be returned to Pirelli according to FIA rules.


### Summary Table: F1 Tyre Allocation by Weekend Type (2025)

| Session/Type | Dry Sets | Hard | Medium | Soft | Inter | Wet |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Regular GP Weekend | 13 | 2 | 3 | 8 | 4 | 3 |
| Sprint Weekend | 12 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 5 | 2 |

- *Inter = Intermediate. Wet = Full Wet.*


### Key Points

- Each driver’s allocation is independent; tyres cannot be shared between teammates.
- The number and type of tyres available are strictly regulated and must be managed through all sessions from Free Practice (including Sprint, if present) to the Grand Prix itself[^1][^3][^6][^7][^4].
- Wet-weather tyre allocation increases for Sprints, with five inters and two wets supplied.

This ensures both variety in strategy and parity among teams during every weekend format.
