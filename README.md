## 📌 Topics Covered

1. **FIA Safety Systems**  
   How have the HANS device and Halo improved crash survival rates?

2. **Aerodynamic Innovation Concealment**  
   What tactics do teams use to hide aero advancements, and which are most effective?

3. **Driver Aggression vs. Performance**  
   Does a high aggression score result in better finishes or increased risk (penalties, collisions)?

4. **Team Spending (1950–2025)**  
   How has F1 spending evolved and what’s the relationship with championship success?

5. **Tyre Strategy Analysis**  
   How do Pirelli tyre compounds and degradation affect race strategy across circuits?

6. **Sprint vs. Regular Grand Prix Tyre Allocation (2025)**  
   Breakdown of tyre rules and allocations in modern F1 race formats.
